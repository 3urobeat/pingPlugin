# pingPlugin
This short & simple plugin for Spigot and Bukkit servers tells you your ping to the server when executing `/ping`.

Download the .jar: https://github.com/HerrEurobeat/pingPlugin/releases/latest  
...and put it into the `plugins` folder of your Spigot/Bukkit server. **Done!**  

This plugin was tested on 1.16.1 & 1.16.4 but should also work on other versions.
